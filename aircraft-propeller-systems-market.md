<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Propeller Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pitch Propeller System</li><li>Varying Pitch Propeller System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aircraft propeller systems market is divided into two main types: fixed pitch propeller system and varying pitch propeller system. In a fixed pitch propeller system, the blades of the propeller are fixed in a specific position and cannot be adjusted during flight. This type of system is generally less complex and is commonly used in smaller aircraft. On the other hand, in a varying pitch propeller system, the blades can be adjusted to change the angle of attack, allowing for better control and performance during different flight conditions. This type of system is typically found in larger, more advanced aircraft.</p></p>
