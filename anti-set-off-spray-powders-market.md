<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Set-Off Spray Powders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Type</li><li>Regular Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti Set-Off Spray Powders market consists of two main types: Coated Type and Regular Type. Coated Type powders are manufactured by adding a thin layer of coating on the surface, which helps reduce the set-off effect during printing. This type is commonly used in high-speed printing processes as it provides excellent anti-setoff properties. On the other hand, Regular Type powders do not have any additional coating and are suitable for standard printing operations. Both types are widely utilized in the printing industry to prevent ink transfer and achieve high-quality prints.</p></p>
