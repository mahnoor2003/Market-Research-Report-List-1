<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Beam (Photoelectric) Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-Beam Photoelectric Sensor</li><li>Reflective Photoelectric Sensor</li><li>Diffuse Photoelectric Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive beam (photoelectric) sensor market consists of three types: through-beam photoelectric sensor, reflective photoelectric sensor, and diffuse photoelectric sensor. Through-beam sensors have a separate emitter and receiver, detecting objects when interrupted by the object's presence. Reflective sensors have an emitter and receiver in the same housing, reflecting the emitted beam off the object to detect its presence. Diffuse sensors have a combined emitter and receiver, detecting objects based on the reflection of light off the object. These sensors find application in automotive systems for object detection and distance measurement.</p></p>
