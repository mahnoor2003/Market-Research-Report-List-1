<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seat Belt System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Seat Belt System</li><li>Passive Seat Belt System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive seat belt system market consists of two types: active seat belt system and passive seat belt system. Active seat belt systems are designed to actively detect potential accidents or collisions and immediately respond by tightening the seat belt, pre-tensioning it to reduce forward movement and preventing possible injuries. On the other hand, passive seat belt systems mainly rely on the occupants' inertia during a crash to activate and protect them. These seat belts are designed to lock when a sudden deceleration occurs, restraining the occupants and minimizing the risk of injury.</p></p>
