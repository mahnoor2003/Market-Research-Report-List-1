<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Transient Suppression Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-Polar</li><li>Bi-Polar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive transient suppression diodes are used to protect electronic components in vehicles from voltage spikes and transients. Uni-polar diodes are designed to only conduct current in one direction, blocking the reverse current. Bi-polar diodes, on the other hand, can conduct current in both forward and reverse directions. Uni-polar diodes are suitable for applications where voltage spikes need to be clamped to a specific positive or negative voltage level. Bi-polar diodes provide bidirectional transient voltage protection, making them ideal for applications that require protection from voltage spikes in both directions.</p></p>
