<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Transmission Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Car Manual Transmission</li><li>Double Clutch Transmission</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive transmission systems refer to the mechanism that transfers power from the engine to the wheels of a vehicle. There are various types of transmission systems available. Car manual transmission is a traditional system that requires the driver to manually shift gears using a clutch pedal. On the other hand, double clutch transmission (DCT) is an advanced system that uses two separate clutches for odd and even gears, allowing for quicker and smoother gear shifts. Both systems serve the purpose of transmitting power, but DCT provides enhanced performance and efficiency compared to manual transmission.</p></p>
