<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tubes and Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Welded</li><li>Seamless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive tubes and pipes market consists of two main types: welded and seamless. Welded tubes are made by forming a long strip of steel into a tubular shape and then welding the edges together. They are commonly used for less demanding applications and are economically favorable. On the other hand, seamless tubes are made by piercing a solid steel billet to form a hollow tube without any welding. These tubes offer higher strength and are typically used in more critical automotive applications.</p></p>
