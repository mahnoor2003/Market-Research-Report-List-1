<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Binaural Cochlear Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Body-worn Cochlear Implant</li><li>Ear-worn Cochlear Implant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The binaural cochlear implant market includes two types: body-worn cochlear implant and ear-worn cochlear implant. Body-worn cochlear implant refers to a device that is worn externally on the body, typically behind the ear, and it relies on a microphone to capture sounds and transmit them to the inner ear. On the other hand, ear-worn cochlear implant is a smaller device that is worn directly in the ear, eliminating the need for a body-worn component. Both types aim to provide hearing assistance to individuals with hearing loss.</p></p>
