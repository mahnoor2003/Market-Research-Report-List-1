<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Horns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Horn</li><li>Electric Horn</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Car horns come in two main types: air horn and electric horn. Air horns, traditionally used on larger vehicles like trucks and trains, produce a loud sound by compressing air through a horn-shaped opening. Electric horns, on the other hand, use electricity to vibrate a diaphragm, producing a sound. These horns are commonly seen on smaller vehicles like cars and motorcycles. Both types of horns serve the same purpose of alerting others on the road and ensuring safety, but their technology and design vary based on the vehicle's size and requirements.</p></p>
