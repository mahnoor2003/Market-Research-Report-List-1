<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Creping Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross-Linked Polymer Creping Adhesive</li><li>Non-Cross-Linked Polymer Creping Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The creping adhesives market consists of two main types: cross-linked polymer creping adhesive and non-cross-linked polymer creping adhesives. </p><p>Cross-linked polymer creping adhesives are formulated with polymers that form strong chemical bonds, resulting in a permanent and durable adhesive layer. These adhesives are resistant to water and heat, making them suitable for various applications, such as tissue and paper production.</p><p>Non-cross-linked polymer creping adhesives, on the other hand, do not form permanent chemical bonds. Instead, they rely on physical entanglements to create adhesion. These adhesives provide excellent release properties and are often used in applications where clean release is critical, such as in the production of pressure-sensitive tapes and labels.</p></p>
