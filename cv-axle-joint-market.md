<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CV Axle Joint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outboard Joints</li><li>Inboard Joints</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The CV axle joint market consists of two main types: outboard joints and inboard joints. Outboard joints are located at the outer end of the axle shaft and are responsible for transmitting power from the transmission to the outer wheels. Inboard joints, on the other hand, are situated near the differential and connect the axle shaft to the transmission. Both types of joints play a crucial role in maintaining efficient power transfer and smooth rotation of the wheels in the CV axle system.</p></p>
