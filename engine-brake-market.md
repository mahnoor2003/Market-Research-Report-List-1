<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>An engine brake is a system that helps slow down a vehicle by reducing the engine's power output. There are two main types of engine brakes: compression release brake and exhaust brake. A compression release brake works by releasing the compressed air from the engine's cylinders, which creates resistance and slows down the vehicle. An exhaust brake, on the other hand, restricts the flow of exhaust gases, creating backpressure in the engine and resulting in braking force. Both types of engine brakes serve the same purpose of assisting in deceleration.</p></p>
