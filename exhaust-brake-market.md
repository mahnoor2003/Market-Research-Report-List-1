<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exhaust Pipe Exhaust Brake</li><li>Engine Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Exhaust Brake market can be categorized into two types: the Exhaust Pipe Exhaust Brake and the Engine Exhaust Brake. The Exhaust Pipe Exhaust Brake is a type of braking system that works by creating a back pressure in the exhaust system, which helps slow down the vehicle. On the other hand, the Engine Exhaust Brake is a braking mechanism that uses the vehicle's engine to compress the air, generating resistance and aiding in deceleration. Both types of brakes are designed to provide additional braking power and improve vehicle control in downhill or heavy load conditions.</p></p>
