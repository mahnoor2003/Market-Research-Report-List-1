<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flocculant Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Charge</li><li>Negative Charge</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flocculant blocks are used to clarify water in various industries. Positive charge flocculant blocks attract particles with negative charges, causing them to clump together and settle at the bottom. This type is effective in removing suspended solids and organic matter from water. On the other hand, negative charge flocculant blocks attract particles with positive charges, achieving similar results by causing them to agglomerate. Both market types offer solutions to purify water by promoting particles' aggregation, ultimately enhancing the water treatment process in different contexts.</p></p>
