<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas-filled Radiation Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionization Chamber</li><li>Proportional Counter</li><li>Geiger-Müller Counter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas-filled radiation detectors market consists of three types: ionization chambers, proportional counters, and Geiger-Müller counters. Ionization chambers measure radiation by calculating the number of ion pairs formed in the gas-filled chamber. Proportional counters amplify the ionization current by using a voltage applied between the anode and cathode, producing proportional ion multiplication. Geiger-Müller counters are used to detect and measure radiation using a high voltage that initiates a gas discharge and produces an output pulse. These detectors are essential in industries such as healthcare, nuclear power, and environmental monitoring for radiation detection and measurement purposes.</p></p>
