<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Harvesting Header Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Harvesting Header</li><li>Flex Harvesting Header</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of harvesting headers in the market: rigid and flex. Rigid harvesting headers are fixed and do not offer much flexibility when it comes to harvesting. They work best in flat and even fields. On the other hand, flex harvesting headers have a flexible frame that allows them to adapt to uneven terrains. These headers can efficiently harvest crops on hilly or sloping fields without compromising crop quality. The choice between these market types depends on the specific terrain and harvesting needs of farmers.</p></p>
