<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) Plates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metals</li><li>Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) Plates market includes two main types: Metals and Polymers. </p><p>Metals, such as stainless steel and titanium, are commonly used in HTO plates due to their strength and stability. These plates provide reliable support to the tibia bone during the healing process, ensuring proper alignment and reducing stress on the affected joint.</p><p>On the other hand, Polymers, such as bioabsorbable materials, are gaining popularity in the HTO plates market. These plates gradually degrade over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove them. Polymers offer the advantage of decreased risk of infection and reduced stress shielding, resulting in improved patient outcomes.</p></p>
