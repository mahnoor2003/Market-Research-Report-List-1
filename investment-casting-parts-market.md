<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Casting Parts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Silicate Process</li><li>Tetraethyl Orthosilicate/ Silica Sol Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Investment casting parts market includes two types: Sodium Silicate Process and Tetraethyl Orthosilicate/Silica Sol Process. In the Sodium Silicate Process, a mixture of sodium silicate and refractory material is used to create a mold, which is then dried and heated to remove the moisture. Molten metal is poured into the mold, solidifying into the desired shape. On the other hand, in the Tetraethyl Orthosilicate/Silica Sol Process, a colloidal suspension of silica sol is used for molding. After drying and heating, the sol particles bind together, creating a strong mold for casting.</p></p>
