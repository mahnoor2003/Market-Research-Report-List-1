<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Helium Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>He I</li><li>He II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid helium is classified into two types based on its behavior at extremely low temperatures: He I and He II. He I is the more common form and behaves like a normal liquid, obeying classical physics. It does not exhibit any special properties or phenomena. In contrast, He II is a superfluid that displays remarkable properties, such as zero viscosity and an ability to flow through tiny channels against gravity. This makes He II highly valuable for various scientific and industrial applications, ranging from fundamental research to cooling superconducting magnets and advanced medical imaging.</p></p>
