<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuromuscular Blocking Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-polarizing Agents</li><li>Depolarizing Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Neuromuscular Blocking Drug market can be classified into two types: Non-polarizing Agents and Depolarizing Agents. Non-polarizing Agents block the receptors at the neuromuscular junction and prevent the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles, resulting in muscle relaxation. They are commonly used during surgeries to induce temporary paralysis in patients. On the other hand, Depolarizing Agents initially stimulate the receptors and cause muscle contractions, but their prolonged activation leads to desensitization and muscle relaxation. These agents are also used in surgical procedures to induce muscle relaxation.</p></p>
