<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Protein Nitrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urea</li><li>Ammonia</li><li>Biuret</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-protein nitrogen market consists of three main types: urea, ammonia, and biuret. Urea is widely used as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture and is produced through the reaction of ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia, a colorless gas with a pungent odor, is used in several industries, including the production of fertilizers, plastics, and cleaning agents. Biuret is a byproduct of urea production and is often found in urea-based fertilizers. Although it can be toxic to plants and animals in high concentrations, biuret remains a valuable component in certain applications within the agriculture sector.</p></p>
