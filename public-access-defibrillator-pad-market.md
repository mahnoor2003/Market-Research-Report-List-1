<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Public Access Defibrillator (PAD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Public Access Defibrillators (PAD) are life-saving devices used to treat sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) in public places. The market offers two types: semi-automated and fully automated. Semi-automated PADs require the user to manually initiate the shock, following voice prompts. Fully automated PADs, on the other hand, deliver the shock automatically after analyzing the heart rhythm. Both types serve the purpose of providing immediate aid to individuals suffering from SCA, but vary in terms of user involvement during the defibrillation process.</p></p>
