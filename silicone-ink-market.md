<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Ink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Drying Type Silicone Ink</li><li>UV Curable Cilicone Ink</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Silicone ink is categorized into two main types: thermal drying type and UV curable type. Thermal drying silicone ink requires a heat source to dry and cure the ink after printing. On the other hand, UV curable silicone ink uses ultraviolet light to instantly cure and harden the ink, eliminating the need for additional drying time. Both types offer their unique advantages in terms of application, durability, and compatibility with different substrates.</p></p>
