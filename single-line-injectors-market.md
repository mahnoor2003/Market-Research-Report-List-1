<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-line Injectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parallel</li><li>Progressive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Single-line injectors are commonly used in industrial applications for lubricating machinery and equipment. There are two main types of single-line injectors: parallel and progressive. </p><p>Parallel injectors distribute lubricant simultaneously to multiple lubrication points through separate lines, ensuring equal distribution to each point. This type is ideal for equipment with identical lubrication requirements, optimizing efficiency.</p><p>On the other hand, progressive injectors distribute lubricant sequentially from one point to another. Each lubrication point is served one at a time in a predetermined order. This type is suitable for machinery with different lubrication needs or with complex systems requiring precise lubrication at specific intervals.</p></p>
