<p><strong>The Solvent-based Pressure Sensitive Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided Tapes</li><li>Double-sided Tapes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent-based pressure sensitive tape is a type of adhesive tape that utilizes solvents in its formulation. There are two main market types for this tape: single-sided tapes and double-sided tapes. Single-sided tapes have adhesive on only one side, which allows them to stick to a surface when pressure is applied. They are commonly used for packaging, sealing, and masking applications. In contrast, double-sided tapes have adhesive on both sides, enabling them to join two surfaces together. They are widely used in industries such as construction, automotive, and electronics for bonding purposes.</p></p>
