<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Fixation Product Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal fixation product market is divided into two main types: spinal fusion products and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion involves the joining of two or more vertebrae using bone grafts, screws, and rods to stabilize the spine. This procedure is commonly used to treat spinal deformities and injuries. On the other hand, non-fusion products aim to enhance spinal stability without fusion. These products include dynamic stabilization devices, artificial discs, and interspinous process spacers. Non-fusion products provide flexibility while maintaining spinal alignment and reducing pain.</p></p>
