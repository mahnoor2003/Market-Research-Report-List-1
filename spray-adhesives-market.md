<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based</li><li>Water-based</li><li>Hot Melt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray adhesives are versatile products used for bonding various materials. Solvent-based adhesives use solvents to disperse the adhesive components. They are quick-drying, offer strong and durable bonds, but may emit harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Water-based adhesives, as the name suggests, use water as the dispersion medium. They are more environmentally friendly, have low VOC emissions, but may require longer drying times. Hot melt adhesives are solid at room temperature and are heated using a special applicator. They cool and solidify rapidly, providing fast and strong bonds for materials like plastics and fabrics.</p></p>
