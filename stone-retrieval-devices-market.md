<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Retrieval Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitinol Stone Basket</li><li>Stainless Steel Stone Basket</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stone retrieval devices are medical tools used during endoscopic procedures to remove kidney or bladder stones. There are two main types commonly used - Nitinol Stone Basket and Stainless Steel Stone Basket. Nitinol Stone Baskets are made from a nickel-titanium alloy that provides flexibility and shape recovery. They are suitable for retrieving smaller stones due to their smaller basket size. On the other hand, Stainless Steel Stone Baskets are made from stainless steel, offering strength and durability. They are used for larger stones due to their larger basket size. Both types play a crucial role in effective stone removal.</p></p>
