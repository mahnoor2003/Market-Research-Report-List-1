<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Peptide Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS)</li><li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Synthetic peptide vaccines are divided into two market types: Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). In Solution Phase Synthesis, the vaccine is created by chemically synthesizing the peptide in a liquid solution. This method allows for better control over the reaction conditions and purity of the final product. On the other hand, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis involves attaching the peptide to a solid support and sequentially adding amino acids to construct the vaccine. SPPS is widely used due to its efficiency, scalability, and ease of purification.</p></p>
