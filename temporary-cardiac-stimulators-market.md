<p><p>Temporary cardiac stimulators are medical devices used to support and regulate the patient's heart rhythm until a permanent pacemaker can be implanted. There are four types of temporary stimulators: VVI, VOO, AAI, and AOO. VVI stimulators stimulate the ventricles of the heart, VOO stimulators deliver fixed-rate electrical impulses to both ventricles, AAI stimulators stimulate the atria, and AOO stimulators provide fixed-rate impulses to both atria. These devices are crucial in managing cardiac conditions and ensuring the patient's heart functions properly until a permanent solution can be implemented.</p></p>
