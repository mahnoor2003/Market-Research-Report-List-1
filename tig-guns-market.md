<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>TIG guns are used in the welding process for joining metals. They come in two types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled TIG guns use water to cool down the welding torch, preventing it from overheating during extended use. They are commonly preferred for high-amperage applications and heavy-duty welding tasks. On the other hand, air cooled TIG guns rely on air circulating around the torch to dissipate heat. They are typically used for lower-amperage jobs and are more lightweight and maneuverable. Both options have their advantages and are chosen based on specific welding needs.</p></p>
