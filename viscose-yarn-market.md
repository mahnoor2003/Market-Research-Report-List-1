<p><strong>The Viscose Yarn Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viscose Process</li><li>Lyocell Process</li><li>Modal Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Viscose yarn is widely used in various industries for its versatility and softness. The Viscose process involves chemically treating cellulose from wood pulp to create a viscous solution, which is then extruded into yarn. Lyocell process is similar, but it uses a non-toxic solvent to produce a stronger and more sustainable yarn. Modal process combines the Viscose and Lyocell processes, resulting in a yarn with enhanced strength and absorbency. All three processes yield high-quality yarns that are utilized in clothing, home textiles, and non-woven fabrics.</p></p>
